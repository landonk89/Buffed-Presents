# Buffed Presents for Lethal Company.
Modifies the GiftBoxItem to randomly contain a buyable item (flashlight, boombox, ect) or else increase value of the existing scrap item inside.
This version targets Lethal Company v45 but may work fine with the next updates.

User can configure the chance percentage (0-100%) and min/max (0-10x currently) multipliers for the scrap value increase using the config file or BepInEx configuration manager plugin.
